# fetch_blob

Download binary content from a WorkIQ path. The tool returns up to 4 MB of file bytes as base64 plus content type, file name, and size metadata. Use this for file content, email attachments, document downloads, profile photos, and other binary Microsoft 365 resources.

## Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `path` | string | Yes | The relative WorkIQ path to the binary resource (e.g., `/me/drive/items/{id}/content`, `/me/messages/{id}/attachments/{attachmentId}/$value`). Do not include a base URL. |
| `format` | string | No | A `$format` conversion value such as `pdf`; honored only on compatible drive-content endpoints. |
| `agentId` | string | No | Target a specific M365 Copilot agent. |

## When to Use

- Downloading a file from OneDrive or SharePoint
- Retrieving an email attachment
- Downloading exported content

Distinguish from `fetch`: use `fetch_blob` when the path returns binary content (files, raw attachment bytes). Use `fetch` when the path returns JSON.

## Path Conventions

| Resource | Path pattern |
|----------|-------------|
| OneDrive file content | `/me/drive/items/{id}/content` |
| SharePoint file content | `/drives/{driveId}/items/{id}/content` |
| Email attachment (raw) | `/me/messages/{id}/attachments/{attachmentId}/$value` |

## Workflow

1. Use `fetch` to list items and retrieve their IDs (e.g., `/me/drive/root/children`)
2. Use `fetch_blob` with the content path to download the binary data.
3. Decode `base64Content` only when the host needs to materialize the returned bytes locally.

If the response reports that the payload is too large, do not retry path variants. The tool limits downloads to 4 MB; return the item's `webUrl` so the user can download it directly.

## Examples

### Download a file from OneDrive by item ID
```json
{ "path": "/me/drive/items/{id}/content" }
```

### Download an email attachment
```json
{ "path": "/me/messages/{messageId}/attachments/{attachmentId}/$value" }
```

### Download a file from a shared drive
```json
{ "path": "/drives/{driveId}/items/{itemId}/content" }
```

### Download a drive item converted to PDF
```json
{
	"path": "/me/drive/items/{id}/content",
	"format": "pdf"
}
```
